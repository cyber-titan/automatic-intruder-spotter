# automatic-intruder-spotter

An Arduino UNO based project which offers protection by detecting intruders in places like home, offices, etc.

We are providing a home security for the theft by implementing automatic intruder spotter using ultrasonic sensor and SIM 900a. 
Now-a-days, the IOT plays a major role in many fields by automating and application. 
This principle is used to detect the stranger entering into the house. Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the motion of an intruder or a burglar. 
If the motion is detected toa owner, then sends an alert call through a SIM900a. The phone call is to alert the owner about the stranger action. 
The proposed work provides a smart home automation system for theft detection. The house owner can be alert and get the protection to their house.
